# Mechatronics-Engineering-for-Design-and-Manufacturing-Project-and-Labs
Designing, manufacturing, and implementing working prototypes of components using an Arduino board and C. The final project involved data analysis and automation of a system for the automatic detection and capture of solar energy through the use of a photoresist-actuated compact concentrated photovoltaic cell.
